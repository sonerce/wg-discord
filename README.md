This repository provides a minimal WireGuard configuration that routes only Discord traffic through a secure VPN tunnel.

🔒 Features:

Routes only Discord domains and IP ranges through WireGuard

Keeps all other traffic on your regular internet connection

Helps bypass Discord network blocks or restrictions

Lightweight, fast, and easy to use

⚙️ Usage:

Install and configure WireGuard
 on your device.

Open the provided configuration file.

Replace the Endpoint value with your own WireGuard server’s IP address and port (e.g. Endpoint = 123.45.67.89:51820).

Import the config into your WireGuard client.

Activate the tunnel — only Discord traffic will pass through it.

🚀 Perfect for users who want a dedicated, isolated, and efficient VPN tunnel just for Discord without routing all internet traffic.
